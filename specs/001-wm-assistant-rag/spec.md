# Feature Specification: WM Assistant AI Chatbot

**Feature Branch**: `001-wm-assistant-rag`  
**Created**: 2024-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "WM Assistant AI chatbot for customer support queries using RAG with ChatGPT 4o mini"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Customer Query Resolution (Priority: P1)

A customer visits the WM website and needs help with a service-related question. They interact with the WM Assistant to get accurate, helpful information about their query without needing to contact human support.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing immediate, accurate answers to customer questions reduces support load and improves customer satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by asking the assistant various customer questions and verifying it provides accurate responses based on the support database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer asks "How do I transfer my service when moving?", **When** they submit the query to WM Assistant, **Then** they receive a clear, step-by-step response with actionable instructions
2. **Given** a customer asks "What materials are not allowed in my dumpster?", **When** they submit the query, **Then** they receive a comprehensive list of prohibited items with clear explanations
3. **Given** a customer asks about billing questions, **When** they interact with the assistant, **Then** they receive accurate billing information and guidance

### User Story 2 - Intelligent Response Enhancement (Priority: P2)

The WM Assistant provides enhanced responses by making URLs clickable and maintaining a conversational, helpful tone that reflects WM's brand values.

**Why this priority**: Enhanced user experience through clickable links and proper brand voice increases customer satisfaction and reduces friction in getting help.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by verifying that responses contain clickable URLs and maintain appropriate tone and formatting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a response contains a URL from the support database, **When** the response is displayed to the user, **Then** the URL is rendered as a clickable link
2. **Given** the assistant provides any response, **When** the user reads it, **Then** the tone is helpful, professional, and aligned with WM's customer service standards
3. **Given** the assistant cannot find relevant information, **When** it responds, **Then** it provides a helpful message without directing users to contact customer service
4. **Given** the assistant provides any response, **When** the user reads it, **Then** it should be concise and conversational, avoiding lengthy explanations unless specifically requested
5. **Given** a customer asks a complex question with multiple aspects, **When** the assistant responds, **Then** it should provide a brief initial answer and ask relevant follow-up questions to maintain conversational flow

### User Story 3 - RAG-Powered Knowledge Retrieval (Priority: P3)

The WM Assistant uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChatGPT 4o mini to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses based on the support database.

**Why this priority**: RAG implementation ensures responses are grounded in official WM content while leveraging AI for natural language understanding and response generation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by verifying that responses are generated using the RAG system and are accurate to the support database content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer asks a question, **When** the RAG system processes it, **Then** it retrieves relevant content from the support database and generates an appropriate response
2. **Given** the support database is updated, **When** a customer asks a related question, **Then** the assistant provides current information reflecting the updates
3. **Given** a query has no relevant content in the support database, **When** the assistant responds, **Then** it clearly states the limitation without providing incorrect information
