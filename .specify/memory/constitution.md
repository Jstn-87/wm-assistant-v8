# WM AI Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Customer-First Support
The chatbot must prioritize accurate, helpful, and empathetic responses to customer queries. Every interaction should reflect WM's commitment to excellent customer service. Responses must be clear, actionable, conversational, and aligned with WM's brand voice and values. The assistant should maintain brevity while being helpful, and ask relevant follow-up questions to avoid verbose explanations and maintain engaging conversation flow.

### II. Knowledge Base Integrity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All responses must be grounded in the official WM support database. The chatbot shall never provide information not contained in the support_database.json or provide guidance that contradicts official WM policies. When uncertain, the chatbot must clearly state limitations and direct customers to appropriate human support channels.

### III. Scope Discipline
The chatbot's initial scope is strictly limited to handling customer queries relevant to existing support content. Features outside this scope (e.g., account management, billing modifications, service scheduling) must be explicitly deferred to human agents with clear escalation paths.

### IV. Privacy & Security
Customer data protection is paramount. The chatbot must not store, log, or transmit personal customer information beyond what's necessary for the current interaction. All data handling must comply with WM's privacy policies and relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

### V. Performance & Reliability
The chatbot must respond within 3 seconds for 95% of queries. System availability must exceed 99.5% uptime. Graceful degradation is required when the knowledge base is unavailable, with clear fallback to human support.

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Requirements
- Backend-first design with clear API boundaries
- Stateless architecture to support horizontal scaling
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring for all interactions
- Version-controlled knowledge base with change tracking

### Data Management
- Support database must be version-controlled and auditable
- All knowledge base updates require review and approval
- Backup and recovery procedures for support database
- Regular validation of knowledge base accuracy and completeness

### Integration Standards
- RESTful API design for chatbot backend
- Standardized error handling and response formats
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms
- Integration points clearly defined for future expansion

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates
- All code changes require unit tests with >90% coverage
- Integration tests for knowledge base interactions
- User acceptance testing for response accuracy
- Security review for any data handling changes

### Knowledge Base Management
- Support content updates require business stakeholder approval
- Automated testing for knowledge base structure and content
- Regular review cycles for content accuracy and relevance
- Clear documentation of content sources and update procedures

### Deployment Process
- Staged deployment (dev → staging → production)
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Customer feedback collection and analysis

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
- Documentation of the proposed change and rationale
- Impact assessment on existing functionality
- Approval from technical and business stakeholders
- Migration plan for any breaking changes

All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear business value. Use the development guidelines for runtime development guidance.
